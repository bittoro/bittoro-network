Hi, welcome to Lokinet public beta!

Lokinet is a private, decentralized and Market based, Sybil resistant overlay network for the internet.

This package contains the reference implementation of LLARP.

This software is in its early stages, please do not use it for anything mission critical, by default you are using the betanet which is mostly run by node operators from the Loki team.
